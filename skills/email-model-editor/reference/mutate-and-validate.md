# Mutate and validate the model

Validation runs the editor's own Document State rules bundled into the SDK. No schema download
or initialization is required. `bundle.json.editorValidator` records the editor revision.
`finish()` validates edits against the acquired input; create mode validates a new document.
The service also validates its deployed revision and applies the write to its live state;
local success does not establish persistence.

## 2. Write the change module

Create one task-local file such as `<workspace>/email-<id>.changes.mjs`. Export a function and
mutate only the supplied `email` handle:

```js
export default ({ email }) => {
  const logos = email.select({
    nodeKind: "block",
    type: "image",
    inMessageArea: "header",
  });
  if (logos.length !== 1) {
    throw new Error(`Expected one header logo, found ${logos.length}.`);
  }
  logos[0]
    .setSrc("https://cdn.acme.example/logo.png")
    .setAlt("Acme")
    .setHref("https://acme.example/");
};
```

For preheader requests, read the current `summary.metadata.preheader` and use
`email.setMetadata(patch)` in the change module:

```js
export default ({ email }) => {
  email.setMetadata({preheader: {text: "Discover what's new this season", fillSpace: true}});
};
```

Both `text` and `fillSpace` are required. For a text-only edit, copy the acquired `fillSpace`;
use `false` when there is no preheader. Clear with `{text: "", fillSpace: false}` and keep the
metadata keys. Omitted patch fields are preserved. New or changed text is limited to 500 UTF-16
code units; preserve unchanged imported longer text. Keep the complete acquired model as the
baseline and candidate. `metadata.title` is the HTML document title, not the sending subject;
subject changes belong to `reteno-email-editor`.

Persist this model through `prepare_email_model_upload` and `update_email_model`. Never send a
flat `preheader`/`preHeader` to message metadata, creation, or translation tools, and never edit
`esd-hidden-preheader` HTML. A missing or unhydrated native model is a read failure, including on
an HTML-created copy or language variant; do not initialize a replacement model to bypass it.

Use `email.one(selector)` when exactly one match is required, or `email.block(id, type)` for
a type-checked block. `within` restricts a selector to a subtree. Use `patchSettings(patch)`
for supported settings; unknown keys, arbitrary collection arrays and `undefined` are errors.
Use collection methods for social/menu items, `setSpacerMode` for spacer variants, and
`resetSettings(paths)` for confirmed resets. A line spacer's `settings.mobileBorder` overrides
its mobile line; `null` inherits `border`. `node.describe()` exposes the pinned contract.
Each method is atomic. The synchronous module may also receive `transaction` and group
related changes with `transaction(email => { ... })`; failure restores the whole group.
All ten native block types are represented. Timer reads and unrelated supported edits are
allowed, but preview-dependent changes and unsupported structural actions fail explicitly.

Text-block `setContent()` and `setText()` transplant acquired formatting for copy edits;
supplied new inline CSS and span wrappers are dropped. For intentional inline HTML styling,
derive `updatedHtml` from the block's fresh acquired `content`, preserving unrelated markup,
text, attributes, links, and literal merge expressions. Use `node.setHtml(updatedHtml)` and
assert `node.inspect().element.content === updatedHtml`. This edits native JSON block content
through the SDK; continue through the native-model persistence workflow.

Rules for the module:

- Use the full `EmailDocument` API declared in
  `<bundle-root>/packages/convo-email-agent/sdk/types.d.ts`: `email.byId`, `email.select`,
  `email.first`, `email.theme`, node mutation methods, `remove()`, `repeat(totalCount)`, and
  `insert(componentName, {after: handle})`. `repeat` takes the final total count including the
  original. Use the handles returned by `repeat` for subsequent edits; the original IDs are
  replaced. Insertion also accepts `{before: handle}`.
- Check expected selector cardinality. When a request intentionally targets every match, require at
  least one match before iterating.
- Encode requested strings as JavaScript string literals; never evaluate customer text as code.
- Do not import filesystem, process, network, or shell facilities. The edit function receives only
  `{ email }`; the module's only job is to call SDK mutation methods.
- Preserve unrelated content, links, merge tags, visibility, and compliance content unless they
  are explicit targets. Make structural changes as needed to fulfill the user's request.
- Prefer a theme edit for a broad change and a node edit for an exception. Render precedence is
  inline HTML, block, container, structure, stripe, area theme, then general theme.
- For a text block, responsive `textAlign` accepts `left`, `center`, `right`, or `justify`.
  Use supported `node.style` or `email.theme.style` methods for native styles; intentional inline
  font-size changes use the complete block HTML passed to `node.setHtml()`, not `setContent()`.
- For a social block, edit networks through `setSocialNetwork(typeOrIndex, {url, title, alt, icon})`,
  `addSocialNetwork({type, url, title}, {after | before})`, `removeSocialNetwork(typeOrIndex)`, and
  `setSocialShared({style, iconSize, spaceBetweenIcons, textCustomization})`; `setLink({url, network})`
  changes one link. The editor's rules apply: known networks never carry `icon` (only `type: "custom"`
  does), `alt` exists only while `textCustomization` is on (enable it with `setSocialShared` first;
  turning it off removes every alt). Links support `http(s)://`, `#`, `mailto:`, `tel:`,
  `ftp(s)://`, `sms:`, `tg://`, and `viber:`; a different non-empty, trimmed href uses the
  editor's `other` type. A network `type` has to be one the editor ships an icon for, `title` is at
  most 100 UTF-16 code units and `alt` at most 500 (`String.length`, so `😀` counts as two),
  `iconSize` is an integer 16..64 and `spaceBetweenIcons`
  an integer 0..40 per breakpoint. Social insertion, duplication and deletion are supported;
  `moveSocialNetwork` reorders a network through the collection API.
- Image sources must be email-safe hosted URLs already supplied or authorized by the user, brand,
  or Reteno asset workflow. Prepare unsupported assets before writing the module.
  For a requested generated replacement, delegate to the image workflow in `HOST.md` with the
  current asset URL, dimensions, approved copy, and bounded changes. Preserve text, composition,
  dimensions, and transparency unless the user requests otherwise. Inspect the completed hosted
  image, then insert its URL directly without reuploading or recompressing it. A pending or failed
  image job is not a replacement; report the limitation and keep the original asset until ready.
  WebP, AVIF, and extensionless or otherwise unknown URLs are not confirmed email-safe. Prepare
  or obtain a PNG/JPG/JPEG/GIF before applying an image change with an unsupported source.

For insertion, define and export `components` in this same change module. Each named entry is
`{node, slots, level?}` containing a complete native reference subtree; `level` is `L1` (stripe),
`L2` (structure), or `atoms` (block). Give slots JSON pointers relative to that subtree and use
`inserted.slot(role)` to address a block within an inserted section. Use `slots: []` when targeting
the inserted block directly. The SDK assigns fresh IDs. Removal and duplication need no component
definitions. For a block type absent from the reference, construct a schema-valid native component
in the module using the reference styles.

Block `settings` accept only the keys the editor schema lists for that block type. The model's
top-level `settings` (`general`, `stripes`, `headings`, `buttons`) holds the defaults for every
element of a type, and some of those keys have no block-level counterpart. Check the block
definition before setting a key on a block. When the key is absent there, change the global
setting instead and expect the change to apply to every element of that type in the email. A key
the block schema does not list fails validation as `unsupported property`. For example, button
`letterSpacing` and `textTransform` exist only in `settings.buttons`; the hover effect is the boolean
`settings.buttons.hoverButtonStyles`, with its colors in `settings.buttons.lightTheme.hoverButtonStyles`.

For example, a module can define and insert a text block:

```js
const zeroPadding = {top: 0, right: 0, bottom: 0, left: 0};
export const components = {
  "offer-text": {
    node: {
      id: "offer-text-source",
      type: "text",
      content: "<p>Offer details.</p>",
      settings: {
        backgroundColor: "transparent",
        hideElement: "no",
        includeInOutput: "both",
        padding: {desktop: zeroPadding, mobile: zeroPadding},
        rightToLeftTextDirection: false,
      },
    },
    slots: [],
  },
};

export default ({email}) => {
  email.insert("offer-text", {after: email.byId("<anchor-block-id>")});
};
```

## 3. Run the edit

```bash
node <skill-dir>/scripts/run-sdk.mjs \
  --input <downloaded-model.json> \
  --script <workspace>/email-<id>.changes.mjs \
  --output <updated-model.json> \
  --diagnostics <diagnostics.json>
```

Require exit code 0 and confirm:

- `validation.valid` is true;
- `sdkDiagnostics.mutationCount` is positive;
- `sdkDiagnostics.selectorMisses` is empty;
- `inputSummary` and `outputSummary` show the intended content, block types, and counts,
  including any additions, removals, or duplication needed for the request.

If the requested result already exists, call the supplied `skip(reason)` and return. The runner
reports `skipped` and produces no uploadable output. A setter that silently changes nothing is an
error. Keep the acquired model, inspection, module, candidate and diagnostics as task artifacts.
On any preparation failure, the runner removes stale output. Diagnostics distinguish JSON,
schema, capability, loss and optional runtime stages; inspect `diagnostics.error.issues`.
Local contract validation is against the pinned revision. `--runtime-snapshot <file>` plus
`STRIPO_RUNTIME_PATH` explicitly requests model preflight and fails if context is missing.
Only a successful server set followed by get confirms persistence.

### Inline-style candidate checks

Before uploading requested inline styling, inspect the actual generated candidate for the
exact requested CSS properties, values or removals on the intended elements and the expected
target cardinality. Allow only request-authorized model and HTML differences; preserve
unrequested fields, markup, text, links, and literal merge expressions. For an edit limited
to inline CSS changes on existing HTML elements, compare with the acquisition: only approved
block content strings may differ, and their HTML differences must be the planned CSS additions,
replacements or removals. For a new build, check the intended styles against the brief and
request without requiring an acquired edit baseline. Valid schema and mutation diagnostics
do not prove the requested styling is correct. Correct any local styling mismatch before
uploading.

Repair schema errors without removing intended content. Use `diagnostics.error.errors` and
the untouched acquired model to repair the failing fields. Do not delete a logo or another
intended block just to obtain a valid model; report an unresolved defect if repair cannot complete.

## Model completeness

`update_email_model` takes the complete base and target and merges their differences into the
live document. An optional key present in the base but absent from the target is a deletion.
The editor diffs the uploaded JSON against the full acquired state. Settings are canonical and complete:
every key of `general`, `stripes`, `headings`, and `buttons`, including their `lightTheme` and
`darkTheme` branches, is required, so a missing settings key fails validation before upload. A
stripe's `messageArea`, `includeInOutput`, `padding`, `stripeBackgroundColor`, and
`contentBackgroundColor`, and a column's `settings.width`, must also stay present.

An omitted `stripes`, `structures`, `columns`, or `blocks` array deletes every element it held.
Timer blocks from the acquired model cannot be deleted, including through a parent
`remove()` or `repeat()`. Social deletion is supported in the pinned merge-service profile.
Therefore persist the complete candidate produced from the freshly acquired model. Clear ordinary
values by setting their cleared value. The SDK can remove an image or social link with
`setLink({url: ""})`, or discard `link.salesforce` when `setLink` changes a button's link from
`salesforce_mc` to another type.
Social `networks` is replaced as a complete list: replacing or reordering networks is supported,
including multiple custom networks. Every resulting network still has to pass schema validation
and the editor's icon, alt, and link rules.

Colors live in the theme branches. Change a light color at its `lightTheme` path, for example
`email.setTheme("settings.stripes.lightTheme.content.linkColor", "#2457d6")`, and set a dark-mode
override at the matching `darkTheme` path, where `null` means no override. Switch the button hover
effect with the boolean `settings.buttons.hoverButtonStyles`.

For an intentional reset, write `undefined` or `null` to a nullable setting below. For example,
`email.setTheme("settings.general.backgroundImage", undefined)` clears the email's background image,
and `email.resetSettings(["general.customListStyles"])` disables custom list formatting.

| Path | Settings that accept a reset (`null`) |
| --- | --- |
| `settings.general` | `backgroundImage`, `customListStyles` |
| `settings.stripes.<area>` (`header`, `content`, `footer`, `infoArea`) | `paragraphBottomSpace` |
| `settings.stripes.<area>` (`header`, `footer`) | `backgroundImage` |
| `settings.headings.h1` through `settings.headings.h6` | `fontWeight`, `paragraphBottomSpace`, `fontSize.desktop`, `fontSize.mobile`, `lineHeight.desktop`, `lineHeight.mobile`, `textAlign.mobile` |
| `settings.<section>.darkTheme` | every color |

A nested patch works the same way: `email.setTheme("settings.general", {backgroundImage: undefined})`.
Every other setting, including light-theme colors, global `fontFamily`, `general.hideImageDownloadIcons`, and
whole groups such as `settings.stripes.content`, has no reset; set a new value instead. Do not strip
fields from JSON manually. The runner still reports unintended loss for accidentally absent fields,
unknown settings, and unsupported resets.
