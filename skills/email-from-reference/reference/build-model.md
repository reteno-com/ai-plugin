# Build the native model

Validation runs the editor's own Document State rules bundled into the SDK. No schema download
or initialization is required. `bundle.json.editorValidator` records the editor revision.
New documents validate without a baseline; rebuilding an existing message uses `--baseline`
to preserve the acquired document's context. The service also validates its deployed revision
and applies the write to its live state; local success does not establish persistence.

### 3. BRIEF

Write a version 2 creation brief conforming to [reference/creation-brief.schema.json](creation-brief.schema.json). Start from [examples/prompt-only.creation.json](../examples/prompt-only.creation.json) when useful.
Translate the supplied or agent-authored text reference into the complete native model; the
example's placeholder copy, assets, and destinations are not verified campaign facts.

The brief contains:

- `message`: metadata that Reteno persists outside the editor model, plus local `referenceMode`;
- `model`: a draft using the native editor schema's field names and nesting.

The brief schema describes the wrapper and message metadata. The bundled editor schema
defines the editor model. Put global styles in `model.settings` and content under
`model.stripes[].structures[].columns[].containers[].blocks[]`.

The builder supplies omitted node IDs and default settings. Supply the complete intended
topology, each column's `settings.width` in pixels, and the content of every block:

- Text: `type: "text"` with `content` containing semantic HTML.
- Image: `type: "image"` with `settings.src`; optional `settings.altText.text` and native `settings.link`.
- Button: `type: "button"` with `settings.text` and native `settings.link`, such as
  `{ "type": "site", "value": "https://example.com" }` or `{ "type": "email", "value": "mailto:help@example.com" }`.
- Spacer: `type: "spacer"`; use `settings.mode: "line"` for a rule or `"space"` for a gap.
- Social: `type: "social"` with `settings.networks`, one entry per icon such as
  `{"type": "instagram", "link": {"type": "site", "href": "https://www.instagram.com/brand"}}`.
  The builder infers a missing link type from the href, defaults the title to the network name,
  and fills the editor defaults (`style: "logoColored"`, `iconSize: 32`, centered). Social links
  support `http(s)://`, `#`, `mailto:`, `tel:`, `ftp(s)://`, `sms:`, `tg://`, and `viber:`;
  other non-empty, trimmed hrefs use `type: "other"`, matching the editor's link contract. Known networks
  never carry `icon`; the editor derives it from the type and the block `style`. Only
  `type: "custom"` requires an `icon` URL. `alt` is allowed only with `settings.textCustomization:
  true`, which then requires it on every network; supplying `alt` on any network enables it. A
  network `type` has to be one the editor ships an icon for, `title` is at most 100 UTF-16 code units
  and `alt` at most 500 (`String.length`, so `😀` counts as two). `iconSize` is an integer 16..64
  and `spaceBetweenIcons` an integer 0..40. The
  persisted schema does not express these rules, but the editor rejects the write when they are
  broken, so the builder validates them locally.

For an authorized logo, native image dimensions use `size`, not `width`, and an image link uses
`href`, not the button's `value`. For example (replace the asset and destination with verified URLs):

```json
{"type":"image","settings":{"src":"https://example.com/logo.png","altText":{"text":"Target brand"},"size":{"desktop":{"mode":"width","px":170},"mobile":{"mode":"width","px":170}},"responsiveMobile":false,"link":{"type":"site","href":"https://example.com/"}}}
```

Set section areas through stripe `settings.messageArea`. Global settings supply section colors
and button defaults; explicit node settings take precedence. Global colors live in each section's
`lightTheme` branch, for example `settings.stripes.lightTheme.content.linkColor` or
`settings.buttons.lightTheme.buttonColor`; `darkTheme` mirrors it, and `null` there means no dark override. Images default to their column's
width with matching desktop/mobile sizes. Set both sizes explicitly when different sizes are
intended. Supplied IDs and fields are preserved except that bare email button targets receive
the `mailto:` prefix required for persistence. Duplicate IDs fail validation.

Global settings and block settings are different schemas. `model.settings` (`general`, `stripes`,
`headings`, `buttons`) holds the defaults for every element of a type, but a block's own
`settings` accepts only the keys the editor schema lists for that block type, and some global
keys have no block-level counterpart. Check the block definition before
adding a key to a block. When the block schema lacks the key, the global setting is the only way
to change it, and it then applies to every element of that type in the email. A key the block
schema does not list fails validation as `unsupported property`. For example, button
`letterSpacing` and `textTransform` exist only in `settings.buttons`; the hover effect is the boolean
`settings.buttons.hoverButtonStyles`, with its colors in `settings.buttons.lightTheme.hoverButtonStyles`.

The unified SDK covers text, image, button, spacer, social, menu, video, timer, HTML and
unknown blocks with native types and canonical defaults. Use `createBlock`, `createStructure`
and `createStripe` for programmatic creation; layout widths are positive weights on write.
Menu and social arrays use explicit collection methods. Timer/video changes that require an
unavailable preview fail rather than fabricate assets. Preserve supplied native values and
resources. For a rebuild, use the acquired target as `baselineEmailJson`, or use
`createDocument({current})`; deleting content must still respect nested timer restrictions.
Creation and editing use the same current/target preparation and loss
guards. The successful result is the normalized validated JSON; failed preparation removes
stale output. An optional encoded-model preflight is stronger local evidence, while a server
set followed by get is required to confirm persistence.

The builder's defaults are fixed values, not the live document's values. The candidate and base
are complete models; persistence applies their differences to the live state for a rebuild,
while creation replaces the new shell. Settings are canonical and complete:
every key of `general`, `stripes`, `headings`, and `buttons`, including both theme branches, is
required, so a missing settings key such as `general.hideImageDownloadIcons` fails validation
instead of being reset. Unset optional values are `null`: background images, custom list styles,
paragraph bottom space, heading font weight, and every dark-theme color. For an explicit full rebuild,
use the acquired target as the validation baseline and provide complete intended settings
following the selected reference and user instructions. Preserve unrequested metadata. Never persist a
partial document; `email-model-editor` describes resets under Model completeness.
Put requested or copied preheaders in `model.metadata.preheader`, for example
`{"text":"Discover what's new this season","fillSpace":true}`. Both fields are required.
For text-only changes, preserve the reference/target's `fillSpace`; use `false` when no preheader
exists. Clear with `{text: "", fillSpace: false}` rather than deleting keys. Preserve unrequested
metadata. The builder validates new or changed text against the 500 UTF-16 code-unit limit.
`message.subject` is the sending subject; `model.metadata.title` is the HTML document title.
Keep `message.preheader` and `message.preHeader` absent; preheaders belong only in the model.

Prefer semantic text, image, button, spacer, and social blocks for newly drafted content. Preserve other
schema-valid native blocks from the reference; do not replace editable content with newly authored
raw HTML blocks. Text-block `content` is limited to the semantic markup needed inside that block.

Build a complete email. In Exact, preserve the source's intentional content and desktop/mobile
structure; do not add a new section or CTA merely to improve the design. In Tailored and Creative,
use a meaningful opening, message body, clear action when appropriate, and compliant footer.

Copy explicitly designated by the user for the target email may be used regardless of its
transport. Do not copy other source-specific wording, identities, offers, URLs, legal text, or
private data unless the user has authorized them and they pass the verified target requirements.
In Exact, an authorized reproduction includes the source's visible copy and assets unless the
user requests changes. In Tailored, preserve the primary CTA's label and presented action but
use the target's approved destination. Record the chosen regime, source PNGs, intended changes,
and any unavoidable fidelity limits in `sourceSummary`.

New reference emails copy editable content rather than saved-library bindings. A source
`moduleId` is read-only and cannot be inserted on the new structural IDs. The builder detaches
it only when that module's editable blocks are present, preserves those blocks and their
styling, and lists the removed bindings in diagnostics `detachedModules`. Report the copied
content as detached; do not claim saved-module identity or synchronization. Existing-email
content edits preserve their acquired bindings. If retaining a saved-library identity is an
explicit requirement, this creation path is unsupported; report it instead of using detached
content to claim library reuse. An unresolved module must be acquired completely before copying.

### 4. DEFINE native fonts

Preserve typography from the authorized reference. Put custom-font definitions in
`model.resources.fonts` and select their font-family stacks in native body, heading, button,
and block settings. Each definition has `fontFamily` plus one of:

- `importMethod: "link"` or `"import"`, with the hosted stylesheet `url`;
- `importMethod: "fontFace"`, with ready-to-inline `css` and an optional source `url`.

Set each resource's `fontFamily` to the complete stack assigned in settings, including
fallbacks: for `Inter, Arial, sans-serif`, use `inter,arial,sans-serif`. The editor matches the
canonical stack when connecting resources. In `fontFace` CSS, the `@font-face` family remains
the primary name, such as `Inter`.

Use the native schema to validate the definitions. Keep existing font resources needed by the
model, including during rebuilds. Fonts and fallback stacks remain as requested. No separate
shell-font plan is needed: font resources travel in the same document upload as the content.

### 5. BUILD

Run the fixed TypeScript-generated builder:

```bash
node <skill-dir>/scripts/create-from-brief.mjs \
  --brief <creation-brief.json> \
  --output <new-model.json> \
  --diagnostics <diagnostics.json>
```

For a full rebuild, acquire the target before building and add `--baseline <target-model.json>`
to the command. Pass its untouched, complete native model. This allows unchanged imported
title/preheader text above 500 UTF-16 code units while still rejecting changed text above the
limit. For a new email, omit `--baseline`; do not use a reference as the target baseline.

Require a zero exit code and schema-valid output. Inspect diagnostics for stripe, structure, column, container, and block counts. Re-open the output when needed to verify exact copy, links, asset URLs, merge tags, areas, and visibility. Correct the brief and rebuild; do not patch generated JSON ad hoc.

The builder assigns fresh structural IDs to copied or rebuilt content so reference IDs cannot
collide with existing blocks in the destination. Reuse the generated model file for persistence
retries; rebuilding assigns new IDs. Bounded edits use `email-model-editor` and retain target IDs.

Repair schema errors without removing intended content. Read the field errors in
`diagnostics.error.errors` and compare the failing block with its native reference. A technical
failure is not a reason to drop a logo or simplify the design. If repair cannot complete, keep
the draft and report the defect; do not redefine the intended result merely to pass validation.
