description: Read live Reteno messaging and events analytics exports through Reteno MCP, download and inspect the local CSV or JSON, and answer with a concise summary unless exports are explicitly requested. Use for campaign/messaging performance, open/click/delivery/conversion rates, channel performance, event counts, and event type lookups.

# Reteno Analytics

## Overview

Use this skill when the user asks for Reteno analytics such as campaign or messaging performance, workflow send rankings, open/click/delivery/conversion rates, channel or media-type performance, event counts, event type lookup, or conversion-share calculations that depend on Reteno MCP analytics exports.

This skill is read-only. Query Reteno through MCP, download export artifacts with `curl`, inspect the local CSV or JSON files, and answer from local rows rather than the manifest envelope.

Default to a summary-only answer. Only return or attach exported files if the user explicitly asks for them.

## Workflow

1. Identify the analytics question and choose the smallest Reteno MCP query that answers it.
   - Use `get_messaging_analytics(group_by, date_from?, date_to?, workflow_ids?, message_ids?, media_types?, conversion_event?, order_by?)` for send, delivery, open, click, bounce, spam, unsubscribe, revenue, channel, media-type, or conversion metrics.
   - Use `get_events_analytics(date_from?, date_to?, event_type_ids?)` for event-count denominators or event-volume breakdowns.
   - Use `get_event_types(event_type_ids?, event_key?, search?)` first when the user provides an event name/key and you need to resolve the exact event type identifier before running analytics.
2. Call the relevant MCP tool with the selected organization only.
   - Avoid exploratory loops. `get_messaging_analytics` and `get_events_analytics` are limited to 10 calls per 60 seconds per MCP client/tool.
   - Prefer one precise analytics query, then do filtering, ranking, and aggregation from the downloaded CSV.
3. If the tool returns a manifest with signed artifact URLs instead of inline rows, download the export using `curl -sL "<signed-url>" -o <local-path>` via the Bash tool.
   - Reteno export URLs are signed and short-lived; download them promptly.
   - Do not use WebFetch — it loads the export into the conversation context, wasting tokens on large files.
4. Save downloaded artifacts under `output/reteno-analytics/`.
   - Messaging exports: `output/reteno-analytics/messaging_<group_by>_<date_from>_<date_to>.csv`
   - Events exports: `output/reteno-analytics/events_<date_from>_<date_to>.csv`
   - If the export is JSON instead of CSV, keep the same basename and use `.json`.
5. Inspect the local file and answer from the downloaded rows.
   - Quote the exact `dateFrom`/`dateTo` resolved by the tool.
   - Reflect the manifest `timeRange` and `dataAvailability` in the answer when freshness, timezone, same-day data, or datetime precision matters.
   - Same-day analytics are available but values can change as new events arrive.
   - If the user asked for rankings, compute them from the local rows rather than from the manifest metadata.
6. Keep the response concise.
   - Return files only when explicitly requested.

## Time Range Behavior

- `date_from` and `date_to` accept `YYYY-MM-DD` dates or ISO datetime strings.
- Date-only values cover the full organization-local day.
- Timezone-less datetimes are interpreted in the organization timezone.
- Timezone-aware datetimes use their explicit instant and are reported back in the organization timezone.
- When dates are omitted, the live API default is the last seven organization-local days, including today.
- A single `get_messaging_analytics` or `get_events_analytics` call must not exceed 185 days.

## Messaging Analytics Behavior

- `group_by` must be `organization`, `workflow`, or `message`.
- Allowed `media_types` are `email`, `sms`, `mobilepush`, `appinbox`, and `webpush`.
- When `media_types` is omitted, the MCP default is `email` and `mobilepush`; confirm the resolved channels from `filters.mediaTypes`.
- Every CSV row is separated by `media_type`; never merge channel rows unless the user explicitly asks for a cross-channel total and you label it as computed.
- `organization` rows include `media_type`, core metrics, `reach`, `frequency`, delivery/open/click/conversion rates, and `revenue`.
- `workflow` rows add `workflow_id`, `workflow_name`, and `launches`.
- `message` rows add `workflow_id`, `workflow_name`, `callout_id`, `callout_name`, `message_id`, and `message_subject`.
- `spam`, `bounced`, and `unsubscribed` are message-level only.
- `conversions` is present only when `conversion_event` is supplied. `conversion_event` can be an integer `EventTypeID` or an exact case-insensitive event key/name match.
- `order_by` may use `sent`, `delivered`, `opened`, or `clicked` for all groups. `spam`, `bounced`, and `unsubscribed` are valid only for `group_by="message"`. `conversions` requires `conversion_event`.
- The finest available grouping level is callout/message. Recipient-domain, mailbox-provider, ISP, bounce-reason, recipient-level delivery errors, raw logs, and date-bucket splits are not available from this MCP analytics tool.

## Event Analytics Behavior

- `get_events_analytics` groups only by event type.
- Do not pass or invent `split_by_date` or `source`; those filters are not available on the live API-backed tool.
- Event analytics CSV columns are `event_type_id`, `event_key`, `event_name`, `count`, `launched_workflows`, `stopped_workflows`, `contact_not_found`, and `parameter_errors`.
- Rows are ordered by `count` descending.
- Use `get_event_types` to resolve event keys, event names, conversion candidates, or event type IDs before querying analytics when the user provides a name rather than an ID.
- `get_event_types` returns metadata only. It does not return counts, trends, delivery metrics, or failure diagnostics.

## Active Workflow Counts

When the user asks how many workflows are active, MCP `list_workflows` rows with `status = "active"` are an approximation: the MCP status alone cannot verify whether a workflow is paused or whether its launch conditions are actually wired up. Report the `list_workflows` count, and state that caveat explicitly when the exact business-level active count matters.

## Output Behavior

- Default: summary-only answer.
- Optional: share CSV or JSON export paths only when the user explicitly asks for the file.
- Intermediate analytics artifacts stay under `output/reteno-analytics/`.

## Constraints

- Read-only only; do not create, update, or delete Reteno entities.
- Stay within the selected organization unless the user explicitly asks for cross-organization comparison.
- Inspect the local downloaded artifact before answering whenever the MCP tool returns only an export manifest.
