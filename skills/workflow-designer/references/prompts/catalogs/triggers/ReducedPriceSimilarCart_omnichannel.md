Brief:
This is a trigger for reducing the price of similar products to those abandoned in the cart. The main goal is to attract the user's attention to products that have a reduced price and are similar to those added to the cart. If the user does not dare to buy products from the cart, then perhaps the presence of a discount on similar products will persuade him to buy. Communication is carried out by sending up to 3 messages to different channels.
