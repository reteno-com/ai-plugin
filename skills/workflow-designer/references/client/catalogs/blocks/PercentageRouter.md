functionality: splits traffic across multiple outgoing paths by percentage. In the editor this block is shown as `Split`.
purpose: use it when contacts should be distributed probabilistically rather than by business rules.
when_to_use: use it for traffic allocation, holdouts, controlled experiments, or percent-based audience splits across two or more paths.

## PercentageRouter Shape Params

Percentage routers (`ShapeType.PERCENTAGE_ROUTER`) split contacts by percentages. SDK code must use the agent-facing params below; do not provide draw2d `portName` values.

### PercentageRouterShapeParamsI

```ts
type PercentageRouterShapeParamsI =
  | {
      blockDescription?: string;
      splitEvenly: true;
      branchNumber: number;
      branches?: never;
    }
  | {
      blockDescription?: string;
      splitEvenly?: false;
      branches: number[];
      branchNumber?: never;
    };
```

### Example: even split

```js
const router = sdk.addShape(ShapeType.PERCENTAGE_ROUTER, {
  splitEvenly: true,
  branchNumber: 3,
});
```

For three branches, the SDK writes internal draw2d branch percentages as `33`, `33`, `34`.

### Example: custom split

```js
const router = sdk.addShape(ShapeType.PERCENTAGE_ROUTER, {
  splitEvenly: false,
  branches: [50, 30, 20],
});
```

`splitEvenly: false` can be omitted for custom splits:

```js
sdk.updateShape(router.id, {
  branches: [70, 30],
});
```

### Connecting a specific percentage branch

Use `connect()` with `sourcePort`. There is no separate PercentageRouter-specific connection method.

```js
sdk.connect(router.id, existingTarget.id, {
  sourcePort: 'output2',
});
```

When the source shape is a `PERCENTAGE_ROUTER`, the SDK looks up the percentage for the selected output port and writes the connection metadata as `PERCENT` automatically. Do not pass `percentage` for these connections; the router branch configuration is the source of truth.

### Behavior Notes

- Custom percentages must sum to `100`.
- Branch entries must be numbers only. Objects like `{ portName: 'output0', percentage: 50 }` are invalid in SDK code.
- Internally, the SDK writes draw2d branches as `{ portName, percentage }`. On `updateShape()`, existing `portName` values are preserved by branch index; new branches get `portName: null` so draw2d assigns the real output port.
- `sdk.getShapeParams()` returns the SDK-facing format: even split routers return `{ splitEvenly: true, branchNumber }`; custom routers return `{ splitEvenly: false, branches: number[] }`.
