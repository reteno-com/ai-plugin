name: CheckInGroup
ui_name: Included in segment?
category: condition
sdk_block_type: CheckInGroup
functionality: checks whether a contact belongs to a selected segment before the workflow continues.
purpose: use it to make downstream behavior depend on segment membership without changing the segment itself.
when_to_use: use it when the workflow should branch differently for contacts already included in a segment versus contacts who are not.
