sdk_block_type: Branch
functionality: routes a contact into one of several ordered branches based on rule groups, with an optional fallback path.
purpose: use it when the workflow needs more than two possible outcomes or needs explicit first-match routing logic by `branches` array order.
when_to_use: use it for multi-way decisioning such as segment splits, contact field-based routing, event-based routing, date-based routing, channel availability routing, or any case where contacts must be distributed across several named paths.
note: IMPORTANT: Branch blocks check branches in the exact order of the `branches` array. If the first branch condition matches, the contact goes to the first branch and later branches are not checked. Otherwise the second branch condition is checked, then the third, and so on until one branch matches. `branches[0]` maps to `output0`, `branches[1]` maps to `output1`, and so on. When creating any Connection whose sourceId is a Branch block, you MUST set sourcePortName to one of the exact port names declared in that specific Branch block schema instance. If a fallback branch is used, it MUST be the final branch.

## Branch SDK Notes

Use the loaded Branch schema as the source of truth for branch fields, condition structure, and allowed enum values.
This supplemental note covers SDK-only behavior.

### SDK-only behavior
- `showLabel: false` suppresses the rendered connection label
- Branch matching is sequential in the exact `branches` array order: check the first branch, otherwise the second, otherwise the third, and stop at the first match
- Branch output ports are index-aligned with `branches`: `branches[0] -> output0`, `branches[1] -> output1`, and so on
- For fallback branches (`isDefault: true`), the SDK writes an empty runtime rule set even if author input included conditions
- `sdk.getShapeParams()` returns the SDK-facing `ORConditions` / `ANDConditions` shape even when persisted runtime data uses draw2d `cards` / `restrictions`

### Branch wiring

To build multiple outputs:

1. Add the Branch block.
2. Build the first branch with `addShape()`.
3. Call `sdk.selectShape(branch.id)` to return to the branch.
4. Build the next branch.

When connecting from an existing Branch block to an already existing target, use `connect()` and the exact source port for the intended branch.

## Branch Condition Params

`ShapeType.BRANCH` conditions use the editor's segmentation-card condition format:

```ts
{
  checkType: number;
  fieldId: string;
  operator: string;
  value: string;
}
```

Common `checkType` values:

| Source                      | Value |
| --------------------------- | ----- |
| Custom field, string        | `1`   |
| Custom field, number        | `2`   |
| Custom field, dropdown      | `3`   |
| Workflow context            | `10`  |
| Segmentation event          | `15`  |
| Message activity            | `20`  |
| Segment membership          | `30`  |
| Current day/time            | `40`  |
| Channel availability        | `50`  |
| Custom field, checkbox      | `60`  |

Numeric condition values are raw stored values, not display labels. The SDK does not convert between percent-display values and fractional stored values because it does not receive custom-field metadata. For a fractional number field where the stored value for 30% is `0.3`, use values such as `0.3`, `0.6`, or `0.3,0.6`; do not use `30`, `60`, `30%`, or `60%` unless the field really stores values on that scale.

For `operator: 'BETWEEN'`, `value` must be two numeric values separated by a comma, for example `0.3,0.6`. Decimal fractions use `.` as the decimal separator. Commas separate the range bounds only.

Example for a numeric custom field storing fractional percentages:

```js
{
  checkType: 2,
  fieldId: '7441',
  operator: 'BETWEEN',
  value: '0.3,0.6',
}
```

If exact boundary behavior matters, avoid overlapping `BETWEEN` ranges and use explicit comparison operators such as `GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL` plus `LESS_THAN` in the same `ANDConditions` group.
