name: CurrentTime
ui_name: Current day/time
category: condition
sdk_block_type: CurrentTime
functionality: checks whether the workflow has reached this step on allowed days, in an allowed time window, or both. In the editor this block is shown as `Current day/time`.
purpose: use it to gate progression by the current calendar moment.
when_to_use: use it when a path should continue only during certain days or hours, and should branch differently outside that time window.
