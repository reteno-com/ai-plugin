# Email Deliverability

## Overview

Use this skill for read-only technical setup audits of Reteno email deliverability. It combines Reteno MCP configuration with public DNS and HTTPS/TLS checks similar to the core checks a user would run in MXToolbox.

Do not use MXToolbox as a third-party service in this version. Do not call Reteno mutation tools.

## Requirements

The audit helper needs the `dnspython` package for DNS checks. If it exits with a `dnspython is required` error, install it first (for example `pip3 install dnspython`) and re-run the helper.

## Workflow

1. Call Reteno MCP `get_email_deliverability_setup` for the selected organization.
2. Save the MCP response under `output/email-deliverability/`, for example `setup_<orgId>_<UTC_TIMESTAMP>.json`.
3. Run the audit helper:

```bash
python3 skills/email-deliverability/scripts/audit_technical_setup.py \
  --input <setup-json-path> \
  --output-dir output/email-deliverability
```

4. Read the generated Markdown and JSON artifacts before answering.
5. Answer with a concise summary focused on failing and warning checks first.
6. Share the generated artifact paths only when the user explicitly asks for files.

## Expected MCP Shape

The audit helper expects `get_email_deliverability_setup` to return:

```json
{
  "orgId": 1234,
  "generatedAt": "2026-05-17T00:00:00Z",
  "domains": [
    {
      "id": 123,
      "domain": "example.com",
      "configuration": {},
      "verificationHistory": {},
      "warmupInfo": {},
      "errors": []
    }
  ],
  "sender": {
    "mailingConfiguration": {},
    "sendingDomains": [],
    "publicInterface": {}
  },
  "shortLinks": {
    "sslDomains": [],
    "destinationDomains": [],
    "settings": {}
  },
  "oneClickUnsubscribe": {
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

The `oneClickUnsubscribe` field is retained for MCP compatibility only. Do not turn it into a technical setup finding or recommendation.

## Audit Coverage

MCP-derived checks:
- Domain configuration status, verification history, warmup info, and MCP errors.
- Sender interface availability and sender-domain alignment.
- Mailing configuration and sending domains.
- Short-link SSL domain status.

Public checks:
- SPF TXT existence, duplicate SPF records, basic termination, and estimated DNS lookup budget.
- DMARC TXT existence and policy strength.
- DKIM selector checks only when the MCP payload exposes selector or record names; otherwise DKIM is marked skipped.
- MX records for sender and reply domains.
- CNAME/A/AAAA resolution for technical domains and short-link domains.
- HTTPS/TLS certificate check for short-link domains.
- BIMI, MTA-STS, and TLS-RPT as informational optional checks.

## Output

The helper writes:
- `output/email-deliverability/technical_setup_<orgId>_<timestamp>.json`
- `output/email-deliverability/technical_setup_<orgId>_<timestamp>.md`

Use the Markdown for the human-facing answer and the JSON for detailed evidence.

## Constraints

- Read-only only.
- Stay within the selected organization.
- Never call Reteno create, update, delete, activate, deactivate, or verification-refresh endpoints.
- Treat missing DKIM selector data as skipped, not as failed.
- If DNS resolution fails, report the DNS error in the relevant check instead of guessing.
